From February 10 to March 13, 2025, I worked through the problems in "Learning C++
Programming with Pictures", tackling each challenge systematically. I took the initiative to
independently implement the most difficult concepts, ensuring a solid grasp of complex topics.
Anticipating potential roadblocks in future programming projects, I structured a dedicated
repository to document and refine these challenging cases. Additionally, I proactively explored and
implemented advanced features that could enhance the overall robustness and applicability of my solutions.
